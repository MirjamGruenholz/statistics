### 1a. Heat Action Plan Dhangadhi, Nepal
- **Situation:** Nepal is suffering from increasing heat, particularly affecting vulnerable groups, such as pregnant and lactating women, outdoor workers, older adults and people living in informal settlements and children. The heat risk perception study conducted by the Climate Centre aimed at determining individual strengths and barriers to heat action, present coping practices to heat waves, and to identify potential heat risk reduction measures and communication strategies to change behaviour and minimise heat impact in the city. 
- **Task:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, visualisation, and interpretation.
- **Action:** Using survey data of 1000+ inhabitants and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with vulnerable groups of the city Dhangadhi in Nepal, my task was to clean the data, discuss missing values with the team, and visualise the data in a meaningful way, including plots, tree maps, and geographical maps.
- **Result:** The result was the Heat Action Plan for Danghadi 2025 
- **Software:** R

### 1b. Business Model Analysis: Solid Waste Management System in the Palongkhali Union, Ukhiya Upazila, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh
- **Situation:** In 2019, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, together with the Swiss Red Cross, started a Solid Waste Management project in and around the Rohingya Refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. 
- **Task:** Conducting an extensive analysis to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of the project regarding operations, management, and finances.
- **Action:** Based on expert interviews, Focus Group Discussions, monitoring data, and financial data, I led and conducted the entire analysis. The analysis was conducted in 2023, at the end of the first 4-year project cycle.
- **Result:** The report helped the Swiss Red Cross and the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) decide to extend the project for another 4-year cycle.
- **Software:** Excel

### 2a. Development Policy Thesis: Benefits of Solid Waste Management for Climate Change Mitigation: A Case Study from Gazipur, Bangladesh
- **Situation:** Bangladesh, a South Asian country, is projected to double its waste generation by 2050 due to rapid population growth, urbanisation, and rising GDP. Unmanaged waste leads to a polluted environment and poses significant health risks to people. Waste along the entire waste stream from transportation, operation, treatment and final disposal further emits greenhouse gases (GHG), particularly methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and the short-lived climate pollutant black carbon (ca. 1000x more harmful to the climate than CO2). The thesis tackles the question: _What is the GHG and black carbon emission reduction potential from Solid Waste Management in Gazipur City Corporation in Bangladesh?_
- **Task:** Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for waste, comparison of different waste treatment methods using real-world data from a current project by the Swiss Red Cross (SRC) and the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS), derive policy recommendations.
- **Action:** Based on a waste assessment and project visits, I analysed emmissions of different waste treatment methods, comparing the business-as-usual (1), with the emissions of the project by the Red Cross and the Red Crescent (2) and waste-to-energy with (3) and without (4) energy recovery. 
- **Result:** The SRC/BDRCS waste project in Ward 49 in Gazipur emits 58% less CO2eq and 72% less black carbon (= soot, ca. 1000x more harmful to the climate than CO2) than in the business-as-usual case in the remaining Gazipur City Corporation. The thesis results were presented to the team of the SRC and BDRCS and graded by NADEL with a 5.75/6.

### 2b. Impact Evaluation Proposal for the Swiss Red Cross
- **Situation:** The underlying challenge in the discourse around "localisation" and "locally-led development" in international humanitarian aid and development cooperation is the diverging understanding of these terms and how they should be implemented and achieved in practice. While the structure of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, with its 192 National Societies, is per se
very decentralised, there exist fundamental differences among the National Societies concerning their
capacities and organisational structure. The concept note at hand elaborates the following question: What are “emergent”
approaches to measure the impact of complex and transformational organisational system changes targeted
at ‘localising’ Red Cross’ International Cooperation work?
- **Task:** Interdisciplinary group work to develop a concept note, proposing a monitoring and evaluation framework.
- **Action:** 1) Elaboration of the existing monitoring framework of the Swiss Red Cross, proposing to add one of three tools to measure power imbalances between sister national societies and within teams. 2) Proposition to complement continuous monitoring with a profound evaluation through a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA).
- **Result:** The Concept Note was presented to and shared with the Swiss Red Cross and graded by NADEL with a 5.25/6.

### 2c. Impact Evaluation Proposal for Solafrica
- **Situation:** The project called “Solar Learning Ethiopia – solar vocational training and entrepreneurship program for youth self-reliance in Ethiopia” conducted by Solafrica and partners, aims at improving the economic self-reliance of disadvantaged youths and livelihoods of community members of the Amhara region of Ethiopia through vocational education and training (VET) in solar technology. 
- **Task:** Develop a proposal for an impact evaluation for Solarfrica. 
- **Action:** For the present impact evaluation, we outlined the Theory of Change verbally and visually, assessed the different links of the result chain, referring to other impact evaluation studies assessing the effectiveness of VET on employability and job opportunities. Based on the literature review, we identified the evidence gap on which we focus our impact evaluation. To answer the overall policy question of the _impact of solar TVET on the livelihood of disadvantaged youths and access to solar energy in rural
off-grid households in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia_, we propose to conduct a mixed methods design consisting of Process Tracing and A Randomised Control Trial. In the final part, we discuss this study's relevance for NGOs and policymakers.
- **Result:** The Impact Evaluation Proposal was shared with Solafrica and graded by NADEL with a 5.5/6.
- **Software/Tool:** [BOND Tool](https://www.bond.org.uk/resources/evaluation-methods-tool/)

### 3a. Master Thesis: Good Design is Good Business: How industry interests affect technology policy designs - Exploring the evolution of battery storage policies in the United States between 1999 and 2000
- **Situation:** Battery storage technology is one of the key technologies to facilitate the energy transition, decarbonise the mobility sector, and spread renewable energies. To speed up battery storage innovation, policy interventions are essential. When shaping policy designs to foster the technologies and technological applications needed for change, policy-makers do not act in a vacuum, but are influenced by industry interests. This master's thesis adds insights from innovation studies to the debate on policy designs by exploring _how industry interests affect policy-makers’ technology policy design preferences._
- **Task:** Data collection, development of a unique dataset, theory development, data analysis.
- **Action:** I developed a unique dataset with more than 500 bills and laws on energy storage in the United States between 1999 and 2020; developed a theory on how battery production and battery application industries differently influence policy-makers' policy design choices; conducted a multinomial logistic regression model.
- **Result:** In my thesis, I could show that policy-makers are affected by the economic
circumstances of their constituencies when designing technology policies. Policy-makers representing a state with a larger battery-producing sector are more likely to support technology-specific policy designs; policy-makers representing a constituency with a larger battery-using sector are more likely to support application-specific policy designs (grade: 5.5/6)
